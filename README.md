### Bit Manipulation Technique

> Bitwise AND(&), Bitwise OR(|), Bitwise XOR(^), Bitwise NOT(~), Left Shift(<<), Right Shift with sign extension(>>),
  Right Shift with zero extension(>>>)
* x & x-1 will clear the least significant set bit of x.
* Classic Problems of Bit Manipulation
  1. Decimal to Binary conversion, and vice-versa.
  2. Check if i-th bit is set in a number N.
  3. Check if given number is a power of 2 or not.
  4. An array of size N, contains elements from range 1 to N. One element is repeated twice and one element is missing.
     Find the two elements.
  5. Find the number of set bits in given integer N.
  6. int power(int a, int N); compute a power N using fast exponentiation.
  7. Given two bit positions X and Y, return the number formed with Xth bit and Yth bit being set.
  8. Given two bit positions X and Y, return the number formed by X set bits followed by Y unset bits.
